### **About Me**

I have various experience working in the IT field. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist in Samsung SDS, discovering insights and improving effectiveness for our customers by using data analytics and developing the novel methodology.

Previously, I was Software Engineer at Samsung SDS, where I developed and managed various systems from the Healthcare solution to the SCM system. In the XeedLab, which is the in-startup project of Samsung, I have developed and launched the android applications named "Goodial", which has achieved 5.3K downloads with 4.2 user ratings in the Indian app store.

I am a fast prototype builder, too. To solve the problems or curiosities, I spend my time. From the used-book searching chatbot to the auto trading system, I have focused on reducing the discomforts using technologies. Moreover, I have analyzed varied fields of data for my friends who work in football, healthcare, or the law.
